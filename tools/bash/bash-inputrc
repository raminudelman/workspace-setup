# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on

# Underscores and hyphens are treated equally when completing
set completion-map-case on

# Make completions appear immediately after pressing TAB once, instead of the 
# default behavior which is to show them after pressing twice
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# If set to On, completed directory names have a slash
# appended.

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories

# Use Up/Down Arrow key to navigate through command history.
# Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through
# commands (i.e. more intelligent Up/Down behavior)
"\e[B": history-search-forward   # Down Arrow
"\e[A": history-search-backward  # Up Arrow

# Use Ctrl+Left Arrow for backward word-navigation
"\e[1;5D": backward-word
"\e[5D":   backward-word
"\e\e[D":  backward-word

# Use Ctrl+Right Arrow for forward word-navigation
"\e[1;5C": forward-word
"\e[5C":   forward-word
"\e\e[C":  forward-word

# Use Ctrl+Delete/Backspace for delete word forward and backward:

#
# Type `Ctrl+V` then `Ctrl+Delete`; this will insert something like "^[[3;5~" 
# where the initial "^[" is a visual representation of the escape character. 
# Then the binding is:
# "\e[3;5~": kill-word

# Use Alt/Meta + Delete to delete the preceding word
#"\e[3;3~": kill-word

# Use "Ctrl + Backspace" to delete words backwards
"\C-h": backward-kill-word

# Use "Ctrl + Delete" to delete words forwards
"\e[3;5~": kill-word

# Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'

set convert-meta off

# When you have a folder with lots of similarly named files and you are not 
# sure how far the completion has gone when you press TAB. The first part that 
# has been completed will be replaced by "...", and it is simple to see what 
# you need to type to finish the completion
#
# Example:
#
# $ ls
# longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-4  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-7  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-11  VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt
# longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-6  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-8  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-9
# $ ls long<TAB>
# ...7-4   ...7-6   ...7-7   ...7-8   ...8-11  ...8-9
# $ ls longFileNameLINUX-2.6.3
# 
#set completion-prefix-display-length 2

# Make Ctrl-j and Ctrl-k to cycle through the available completions. 
# This is useful when you get a small number of possible completions (say 2-4), 
# and you know it would be faster to simply cycle through them with a few 
# key presses, than to actually type it out.
# Notice: Ctrl-k used to cut from curser position to end of the line by default
#Control-j: menu-complete
#Control-k: menu-complete-backward

# If set to On, readline will display completions with
# matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather
# than down the screen.
set print-completions-horizontally off
